#Functions with multiple parameters
#Hugo discussed the use of multiple parameters in defining functions in the last lecture.
#You are now going to use what you've learned to modify the shout() function further. Here, you will modify shout() to accept two arguments. 
#Parts of the function shout(), which you wrote earlier, are shown.
# Define shout with parameters word1 and word2
def shout(word1, word2):
    """Concatenate strings with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + "!!!"
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + "!!!"
    
    # Concatenate shout1 with shout2: new_shout
    new_shout = shout1 + shout2
